# CNN Image Predictions: Cat or Dog? 

## Introduction 

The purpose of this repo is to utilize convolutional neural networks (CNN) on a less common and more complex set of images. This time around, I will use coloured images of cats and dogs to train and test the model. In addition, I will also be using a pre-trained model, more specifically, the MobileNet V2 model, to solve some of the problems that my model was faced with.
